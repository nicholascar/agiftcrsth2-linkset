# AGIFT / CRS Thesaurus Linkset 2
This code repository contains a Linkset - a specialised Dataset linking objects in two other Datasets.

This Linkset contains [SKOS mapping properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/#mapping) between Concepts in the [AGIFT](http://data.naa.gov.au/def/agift) and Concepts in the [CRS Thesaurus](https://github.com/CSIRO-enviro-informatics/crs-th) which are both vocabularies of Australian government functions.

This particular Linkset, AGIFT / CRS Thesaurus Linkset **2**, has ben creatd for two reasons:

1. to fix small errors in the URIs used in AGIFT (those ending in URI character artifacts '--' & '_2')
2. to demonstrate the use of two "parallel" Linkstes, that is two Linksets between the same subject & object datasets (here the vocabularies AGIFT & CRS Th)

Other than the URI artifact fixe just mentioned, this Linkset is created in the same way as [the original AGIFT / CRS Thesaurus Linkset](https://github.com/CSIRO-enviro-informatics/agiftcrsth-linkset/).
